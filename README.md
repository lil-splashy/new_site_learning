Using this to get back into learning site building


I'm working on building a new website to re-introduce myself back into Javascript and web development. 

I want to use this as a hobby and really push my mind through this
 
I want to try moving onto Vue in order to see if that would fit my style more. 

I also plan on using this website to eventually be moved onto the home lab and hosted through there.

It is going to take some time but I am excited.
